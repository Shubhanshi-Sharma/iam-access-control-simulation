# IAM Access Control Simulation Using Users, Service IDs, and Access Groups

This project demonstrates how to securely simulate and validate access control using only:
- ✅ **Users**
- ✅ **Service IDs**
- ✅ **Access Groups**

For the following IBM Cloud services:
- 🛠️ **Meta Functions** (IAM Token + Permission Simulation)
- 🧱 **IBM Schematics** (Terraform Infrastructure-as-Code)
- 📊 **IBM Monitoring** (IAM Activity Logs)

This project avoids COS usage and focuses on access control simulation as a secure alternative.
